# 🚗 Dynamic Parking Pricing System

**Capstone Project | Summer Analytics 2025 | IIT Guwahati**
*By Rushi Girdharbhai Vasoya*

📂 **Current branch**: `Rushi`

## 🧠 Overview

A real-time parking pricing engine that dynamically adjusts prices for urban parking lots based on **demand**, **traffic**, **competition**, **vehicle types**, **events**, and more. Built using Python, streamed via **Pathway**, and visualized in real time with **Bokeh**.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Load & preprocess** dataset: fill missing, normalize, encode features.
2. **Stream records** via Pathway in chronological order.
3. **Apply pricing models**:

   * **Model 1**: Simple linear based on occupancy.
   * **Model 2**: Demand model (occupancy + queue + traffic + events + vehicle type).
   * **Model 3**: Market-aware model (Haversine distance + competitor price adjustments).
4. **Clamp prices** between \$5 and \$20 to ensure fairness.
5. **Visualize** in real time with Bokeh (per-lot, multi-model comparisons).

## 🔍 Live Pricing Demo

This is the output for parking lot **BHMBCCMKT01**, showing all three models over time:

**Highlights**:

* 🔵 *Model 1* stays flat (baseline).
* 🧾 *Model 2* responds to demand factors.
* 🟢 *Model 3* introduces realistic fluctuations via competition.
